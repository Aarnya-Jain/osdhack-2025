# The Coder's Dungeon 🏰

Inspired by classic MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) games, **The Coder’s Dungeon** reimagines the exploration of codebases as a **single-player, offline text adventure**.

Navigate your local GitHub repositories as if they were mysterious dungeons — directories become rooms, files become ancient artifacts, and every `go` is a step deeper into the unknown. Perfect for offline play, this game offers a nostalgic, narrative-driven way to interact with your code like never before.
